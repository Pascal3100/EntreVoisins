# Android EntreVoisins Application

Entrevoisins is a neighbours community app that allows neighbours to exchange services between them.  
This repo contains a new feature that presents a detailed page with neighbour details and add the possibility to mark some of them as favorite.  
Favorite marked neighbours appear in a new tab. You can swipe between all neighbours and favorite ones from main view.
